# DNA-Cassette-Tape

This repository includes two codes for post-sequencing analysis and verification of file editing, respectively.  

In `Sequencing_analysis`, we provide the code we used to process the raw sequencing data obtained from the sequencing company.  
In `Editing_analysis`, we provide the code we used to visualize the difference between the sequence data of a text file and its edited version, to show how fountain code magnifys small changes in the file to the encoding DNA sequences.
