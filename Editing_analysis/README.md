# Usage

## Slide_Match

`Slide_Match.py` receives two txt files with one sequence per line and exports a ranking result and a matching map matrix.  
In the same folder, you need to provide the two txt files and rename as the following:  
`sample.txt`  
`pool.txt`   

The program generates 2 outputs:
`matrix_output.txt`
`output.txt`

Use the `matrix_output.txt` to generate a heat map. The heat map can be a mask on the sample sequences for intuitive visualization.
